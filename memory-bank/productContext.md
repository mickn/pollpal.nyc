# Product Context: PollPal.nyc

## Why This Project Exists

PollPal.nyc was created to address a critical gap in the democratic process: the difficulty voters face in understanding where candidates stand on issues that matter to them. Many voters in New York City:

1. Lack the time to research multiple candidates thoroughly
2. Find it challenging to cut through campaign rhetoric to understand actual policy positions
3. May vote based on name recognition or party affiliation rather than policy alignment
4. Need a simple, unbiased tool to help them make informed decisions

This project aims to strengthen democracy by making it easier for voters to identify candidates who genuinely represent their values and priorities.

## Problems It Solves

### For Voters
- **Information Overload**: Simplifies complex candidate information into a digestible format
- **Time Constraints**: Provides a quick way to assess candidate alignment without hours of research
- **Media Bias**: Offers an objective, stance-based assessment rather than personality-driven coverage
- **Issue Prioritization**: Helps voters identify which issues matter most to them

### For Democracy
- **Informed Electorate**: Contributes to a more knowledgeable voting population
- **Issue-Based Voting**: Encourages voting based on policy positions rather than identity politics
- **Increased Engagement**: Makes the voting process more accessible and meaningful
- **Transparency**: Promotes clarity about where candidates stand on specific issues

## How It Should Work

1. **User Journey**:
   - User arrives at the site and is presented with a welcome screen explaining the quiz
   - User starts the quiz and responds to 14 statements about key NYC issues
   - For each statement, user can agree, disagree, or skip
   - After completing the quiz, user sees results showing alignment with each candidate
   - User can explore more information about candidates or retake the quiz

2. **Technical Flow**:
   - User responses are collected as they progress through the quiz
   - JavaScript algorithm compares user responses to pre-defined candidate positions
   - Alignment scores are calculated based on matching positions
   - Results are displayed visually with percentage bars showing relative alignment
   - No user data is stored or tracked beyond the current session

3. **Content Strategy**:
   - Quiz statements are carefully worded to be clear and unbiased
   - Candidate positions are researched from public statements, voting records, and platforms
   - Regular updates ensure accuracy as candidate positions evolve
   - Neutral, factual language is used throughout the site

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: The interface should be clean, intuitive, and free of distractions
2. **Accessibility**: The site should be usable by people of all abilities and technical skill levels
3. **Transparency**: The methodology for matching should be clear and understandable
4. **Neutrality**: The design and content should avoid any political bias or leading language
5. **Engagement**: The experience should be interactive and visually appealing
6. **Mobile-First**: The site should work flawlessly on smartphones, where many users will access it
7. **Speed**: The quiz should be quick to complete (under 5 minutes)
8. **Educational**: Users should learn something about the issues and candidates through the process

## Key Differentiators

What makes PollPal.nyc different from other political information sites:

1. **Focus on Alignment**: Rather than just providing information, it actively matches users to candidates
2. **Local Focus**: Specifically designed for NYC mayoral elections, with locally relevant issues
3. **Non-Partisan Approach**: Strictly issue-based without favoring any political ideology
4. **Simplicity**: Deliberately streamlined to make political engagement more accessible
5. **Visual Results**: Clear visual representation of alignment rather than complex text explanations
6. **No Data Collection**: Respects user privacy by not storing or tracking personal information
