## Current Status

The site is currently in development with the core quiz functionality implemented. A build issue was identified where Jekyll was attempting to process files in a non-existent Python virtual environment directory, causing the build to fail. This has been fixed by excluding the `venv` directory in the `_config.yml` file.

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Verify the build fix resolves the issue
2. Test the site functionality across different browsers and devices
3. Review and update candidate positions if needed
4. Consider adding more detailed candidate information

## Known Issues

1. **Build Process**
   - âœ… Fixed: Jekyll attempting to process `venv` directory
   - Potential issue: Other directories might need exclusion if build problems persist

2. **Quiz Functionality**
   - Edge case: If a user skips all questions, the results may not be meaningful
   - The total number of questions is hardcoded in multiple places (should be centralized)
   - Quiz assumes 14 questions but references totalQuestions = 15 in the code

3. **Content**
   - Candidate positions may need regular updates as the campaign progresses
   - Limited information about candidates beyond their stance on issues
   - No detailed explanations of the issues presented in the quiz

4. **Design**
   - Mobile layout could be further optimized for very small screens
   - Results visualization could be enhanced with more detailed graphics
   - Limited use of animations and transitions
