expanding childcare access, though he hasn’t unveiled a detailed plan

on NYC’s program) and backed a child care tax credit. We can expect
Cuomo to support <em>moving toward</em> universal childcare in NYC over
time, but likely via phased-in subsidies rather than an immediate
free-for-all. He often cites his record of enacting paid family leave
and middle-class tax credits as evidence he helps working families. On
universal childcare, Cuomo would probably seek state/federal funding
partnerships. In summary, <strong>he is open to broadly available
low-cost childcare</strong> (and might resurrect de Blasio’s 3-K for All
initiative), but whether he’d promise completely free childcare for all
families is uncertain – he tends to propose means-tested programs

K-12 (charter schools) rather than early childhood. He would likely

childcare, but <strong>not</strong> for making it entirely free across
the board. Tilson’s approach to helping families is more about growing
the economy (so they can afford services) and cutting waste to reduce
taxes. Thus, he is unlikely to prioritize a huge new childcare
entitlement. He might support targeted childcare assistance, but on the

therapy in schools – an offbeat idea – but nothing about daycare).
Generally, he’d prefer leaving childcare to families, communities, and

He would prioritize finding additional resources (state, federal,
philanthropic) so that both locals and newcomers have support. In
practice, Lander would <em>not</em> support denying services to migrants
to prefer locals; he’d argue the city can and must serve both, though
he’d fight for funding so local services (like schools and shelters) get
expanded. In short, Lander’s priority is <strong>meeting the needs of

Queens neighborhoods with many asylum seeker shelters, Ramos argues for
treating migrants with dignity and securing more resources so <strong>no
group is shortchanged</strong>. She would prioritize getting migrants
work permits and housing so they <em>don’t</em> drain existing services.
Ramos likely <em>rejects</em> the idea of prioritizing natives over
newcomers – instead she’d demand the state and feds help NYC provide for
both. She has stood side by side with immigrant advocates. Therefore,
she would <strong>not favor policies that push new arrivals to the back
of the line</strong> for city aid; she’d try to aid migrants while also
addressing long-term residents’ needs through greater funding and
planning.</p>

welcomed the end of Title 42 (a Trump-era migrant expulsion policy) and
pushed for more legal assistance for asylum seekers. Myrie would likely
echo that NYC must fulfill its moral and legal obligations to shelter
asylum seekers, <em>and</em> get federal reimbursement. He’s not known
for inflammatory rhetoric on this – if anything, he’d try to <strong>add
resources so locals and migrants both get help</strong>. He might,
however, support better coordination to ensure long-term homeless New
Yorkers don’t lose shelter beds (e.g. open additional shelters or
convert buildings). So while he understands local frustrations, Myrie
would <strong>not explicitly prioritize “locals over migrants”</strong>;
he’d prioritize <em>finding resources and housing solutions</em> so that
the needs of both groups are met without zero-sum tradeoffs.</p>

would bristle at the notion of privileging established residents over
newcomers. He has framed the migrant situation as a result of federal
failures and argues NYC should welcome migrants (and push the federal
government for work authorization and funding). Mamdani has been out
front at rallies defending asylum seekers. In policy, he’d likely seek
to expand services (possibly convert hotels into housing) to accommodate
migrants <em>in addition</em> to serving local homeless – rather than
limiting aid to new arrivals. Mamdani often says immigrants are part of
the working class that NYC must uplift. Expect him to <strong>prioritize
humanitarian aid to migrants</strong> while also taxing the rich to fund
housing and services for all. He would <em>not</em> support any “locals
first” resource rationing; rather, Mamdani’s stance is
<strong>solidarity with migrants and demanding more from
Washington</strong>, not curbing services to them.</p>

Stringer would plan better to avoid overburdening certain neighborhoods.
He likely opposes draconian caps or evictions of migrants, but he would
ensure that city agencies continue to meet locals’ needs (e.g. no budget
raids of local services to pay for migrant care without replacement
funds). As comptroller, he monitored spending on shelters and would
demand state/fed reimbursement before cutting NYC programs. So Stringer
would try to <strong>serve both populations</strong>: securing housing
for migrants (possibly through federal sites or spread-out shelters) so
that existing residents aren’t displaced. If forced to allocate limited
aid, he’d use need-based criteria rather than a blanket “NYers first”
rule. In essence, he’d strive so that <strong>local residents don’t see
their services reduced</strong>, but he wouldn’t abandon helping
migrants – he’d push others to shoulder more of that load.</p>

coordinate with faith groups and nonprofits to supplement city aid.
Blake’s stance is that <strong>we shouldn’t play locals against

services. But as a more centrist candidate, Walden likely sympathizes
with New Yorkers who feel overwhelmed. He might support setting clearer
limits or conditions (e.g. only opening shelters with community input) –
which indirectly puts local concerns first. Walden would certainly
demand federal reimbursement for migrant expenses before cutting any
local programs. If necessary, he might put a <strong>temporary cap on
new migrant intakes</strong> simply out of capacity concerns (as Adams
attempted), thereby prioritizing stability for current residents until
more aid arrives. So, Walden’s priority is competent governance – he’d
strive to <strong>minimize impact on local residents</strong> by
securing outside help and improving efficiency, effectively ensuring
locals aren’t deprioritized.</p>

promised to end the right-to-shelter for migrants if it undermines care
for homeless New Yorkers. He also supports relocating migrants to other

residents</strong> – for example, if shelter space or public benefits
are limited, he’d reserve them for NYC residents and encourage migrants
to move where resources exist. This stance is aligned with his broader

states or using Rikers Island to house them out of communities. As
mayor, Sliwa would likely seek to suspend the right-to-shelter for

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Cuomo has not given a numeric housing
target yet, but based on his record and rhetoric, he would probably set
an ambitious goal (perhaps on the order of <strong>500k to 1 million
units over 10 years</strong> for NYC). As governor, he presided over
large development projects and pushed housing initiatives. He signaled
support for upzoning in his last year as governor (proposing transit
station area density and converting unused commercial space). Cuomo is
likely to support <strong>sweeping rezonings</strong> to allow more
housing, especially if paired with affordability mandates – he views
housing construction as key to economic revival. He often references his
“Albany glory days” of big projects (<a class="underline hover:text-blue-600"

who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 - City &amp; State New
York</a>). Expect Cuomo to be bold on a housing goal and willing to
override NIMBY opposition for greater good. He might work with the
legislature to require upzoning in wealthier areas (similar to proposals
by Gov. Hochul). In sum, Cuomo would <strong>set a major housing
production goal and pursue aggressive rezoning</strong> to meet it,
positioning himself as the builder/manager who can get it done.</p>

large-scale housing expansion, <em>with equity in mind</em>. While he
hasn’t put out a single number goal, he has applauded goals like the
500k plan and likely would back <strong>even 1 million units if that’s
what experts say is needed</strong>. Lander helped craft the Gowanus
upzoning as a councilmember and co-authored reports on solving the
housing shortage. He supports <strong>upzoning wealthier
neighborhoods</strong> to create affordable housing, and he co-sponsored
legislation to legalize basement apartments and ADUs. Lander’s approach
to a big housing goal would include strong affordable requirements,
anti-displacement measures, and community input – but fundamentally,
yes, he’d be on board with <strong>“upzoning more
neighborhoods”</strong> to meet a bold target. In fact, he has
criticized the city for not building enough and specifically wants to
get homeless folks into <em>new</em> housing (<a class="underline hover:text-blue-600"

it were housing, she’d want it deeply affordable. As part of the state

legalization (important in her district). Ramos would probably endorse
something like <strong>1 million units citywide</strong> as a goal,
provided it includes tenant protections and doesn’t all fall on a few

was part of the 2018 insurgents who ousted senators blocking NYC
upzonings). Therefore, expect Ramos to <strong>push for a major housing
construction plan</strong> – she’d upzone where appropriate, fight for
state law changes (like Good Cause eviction to go alongside upzoning),

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Mamdani absolutely agrees the city
needs massive housing production, but with an emphasis on public and
truly affordable housing. He hasn’t given a numeric target publicly, but
as a DSA member he supports the idea of a <strong>“social housing”
expansion on a historic scale</strong> (DSA’s platform often calls for
hundreds of thousands of units of social/public housing). Mamdani would
upzone if it guarantees affordable units or is for municipally-owned
housing, but he opposes simply upzoning for luxury development. He has
been critical of rezonings that spur gentrification. So Mamdani would
back a <strong>major housing goal</strong> if it’s tied to
affordability: expect him to push for something like a huge NYCHA-style
program or community land trusts to create housing. He’d likely legalize
basements and convert offices (quick wins he supports) as part of the
push. In short, Mamdani would set a bold housing goal, but he’d try to
meet it by <strong>upzoning for affordable housing and using public
sites</strong>, rather than broad giveaways to private luxury
builders.</p>

thousand units) and pursue rezonings, especially in high-opportunity
neighborhoods that have resisted growth. He’d also reform zoning rules
(he proposed converting hotels to housing and easing parking
requirements in 2021). So yes, Stringer would <strong>upzone more
areas</strong> – but always coupling it with affordability requirements
– to achieve a major housing construction target. He has also endorsed
legalizing basement apartments and office-to-residential conversions to

slogan of “one million units,” but in practice he’d push to
<strong>allow a lot more housing development</strong>. He supports
upzoning wealthier areas (he’s criticized exclusionary zoning) and was
happy when the state lifted the cap on accessory dwelling units.
Tilson’s priority would be cutting red tape for developers –
e.g. speeding approvals, eliminating parking minimums – to let the
private market build more. So yes, he would engage in <strong>aggressive
upzoning across NYC</strong> to meet a high housing target, trusting
that increased market-rate construction plus some affordable set-asides
will improve overall affordability.</p>

development numbers and more on preserving neighborhoods. In 2021, he
opposed the Soho/Noho upzoning and other de Blasio rezonings, reflecting
a bit of a NIMBY streak despite being a Republican. He is skeptical of
luxury development that doesn’t benefit existing residents. However,
Sliwa recognizes the need for housing – he might support converting
vacant buildings to housing for the homeless, and he’s spoken about
using Rikers Island land for public housing. Sliwa would <em>not</em>
likely set a lofty “1 million units” goal; he’d favor <strong>rehabbing
and better using existing buildings</strong> (like filling NYCHA
vacancies, converting hotels to SROs) more than widespread upzoning of
low-density neighborhoods. He often sides with community opponents of
big rezoning projects. Thus, Sliwa would seek to <strong>increase
housing in a more targeted way</strong> – encouraging basement apt
legalization and smaller-scale development – but he would oppose
upzoning that he thinks threatens neighborhood character or caters to
elites. A large-scale upzoning plan is not something Sliwa is inclined
to pursue.</p>

public school inequalities. In short, Lander would <strong>not favor
expanding charters</strong>, and might even seek more oversight on the

Democratic conference to keep the NYC charter school cap in place. She’s
spoken out about supporting public schools with more funding for smaller
classes, higher teacher pay (she helped pass the increase in NYC teacher
pay via state budget), etc. Ramos likely sees charter expansion as a
threat to unionized public schools and as privatization. She would
prefer investing in improving all neighborhood public schools and
expanding bilingual programs (important in her immigrant-heavy
district). Therefore, as mayor, Ramos would <strong>oppose adding more
charter schools</strong>. She might even try to bring certain
charter-like innovations into the public system instead of increasing
separate charters.</p>

public schools. In Albany, he was backed by the Working Families Party

who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 - City &amp; State New

education, he’s more known for advocating college financial aid and
criminal justice education programs. We can infer Myrie would
<strong>not prioritize school choice expansion</strong> – he’d focus on
funding the DOE to implement things like his universal after-school
plan. He hasn’t called for lifting the charter cap; thus, he’d probably
maintain the status quo or even push resources toward traditional public
schools rather than encourage new charters.</p>

<strong>strongly against expanding charter schools</strong>. DSA’s
stance is that charter schools undermine public education and often
operate without sufficient accountability. Mamdani’s campaign platform
is all about public goods – and he specifically has fought against
privatization in housing and transit, so similarly in education he would
oppose privately run charters. NYC-DSA has historically campaigned to
<strong>oppose charter cap increases</strong> and pro-charter
legislation. Mamdani would likely champion fully funding public schools,
reducing class sizes, and perhaps ending charter school rent subsidies.
He certainly would not seek to increase the number of charters or
voucher programs. Expect Mamdani to <strong>defend the public school
system</strong> and push for community control of schools rather than
more choice schemes that he’d say benefit only some.</p>

school advocate aligned with the teachers’ union. In the 2021 race, he
was endorsed by the UFT (until he faced scandal) explicitly because of
his support for public schools over charters. As Comptroller, he did
audits critical of some charter management spending. He also opposed
co-locations that harmed traditional schools. So Stringer would
<strong>not expand charters</strong> – he has said we need to invest in
public schools rather than “shiny alternatives.” He might support
specific high-performing charters continuing, but he wouldn’t raise the
cap or seek to open new ones. Instead, he’s proposed things like
creating 3-K for All (which he did) and more gifted programs in public
schools to prevent charters from being the only alternative. In summary,
Stringer favors <strong>improving public school options citywide, not
increasing charters or privatization</strong>.</p>

He hasn’t been a loud charter proponent, but as a more moderate
Democrat, he likely sees value in some school choice. As an Assembly
Member, he represented the Bronx where some charters (like Success
Academy) operate – he did not actively oppose them. He’s also an Obama
alum, and President Obama supported charter growth. Blake’s education
focus is on equity and youth empowerment. He might be okay with
<strong>some expansion of high-quality charters</strong>, especially
those with a track record in disadvantaged communities, but he would
insist on accountability and not draining public school budgets. He
definitely supports specialized programs like career and technical
education (CTE) and early college high schools. So Blake would probably
<strong>allow charter growth within limits</strong> – for example,
supporting lifting the cap to use “zombie” charters (closed charters’
slots) but not a massive unfettered expansion. He’d also work to
replicate charter successes in public schools.</p>

Walden would be <strong>open to expanding charters</strong>, coupled

areas with failing public schools. Additionally, he’s advocated for
things like merit-based specialized high schools (he opposes efforts to
eliminate the SHSAT exam) – generally promoting choice and competition.
Sliwa also supports parochial and private school options (he’s spoken
fondly of the Catholic schools that many immigrant families choose). So,
expect Sliwa to champion <strong>maximum school choice</strong> –
charters, vouchers, homeschooling, everything – as part of his platform

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Cuomo has not specifically proposed
fare-free buses. As governor, he did not push for free transit, and he
tended to prioritize capital projects (like trains, airports) over
operating subsidies. If elected mayor, Cuomo would likely be cautious
about sacrificing MTA revenue without a replacement source. He might
consider a city-subsidized free bus program if he thought it’d spur
economic activity and if the state kicked in funding – but it’s not a
natural issue for him. He generally took credit for keeping fares steady
(though they did rise) but didn’t float eliminating fares. Thus, Cuomo
would probably <em>not</em> make buses free systemwide unless he secured
a new tax to fund it. At most, he might expand Fair Fares or support
limited-route pilots. In summary, Cuomo is <strong>not inclined to make
all buses free</strong> given the cost, unless it came as part of a
larger deal (for example, he might negotiate something like congestion
pricing funds to offset fare elimination, but that’s speculative).</p>

class and pro-environment. He likely would favor <strong>making buses
free citywide</strong> if a dedicated funding stream can be found (he
might propose a tax on high-income earners or on parking to fund it).
Given his progressive coalition, Lander may very well push for an
expansion of the current 10-route free bus pilot to more routes. He
understands it reduces fare evasion conflicts and speeds boarding. So
while he’d need to mind the budget, Lander in principle <strong>supports
moving toward fare-free buses</strong> as part of a more equitable

current free bus pilots and, if fiscally feasible, work with state

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Ramos has been a strong advocate for
public transit affordability. She was an early supporter of the Fair
Fares program. She also criticized the MTA for service cuts and fare
hikes. While she hasn’t issued a specific free-fare manifesto, her
alignment with transit justice groups suggests she’d be in favor of
<strong>free buses (and possibly subways)</strong> to reduce inequality.
Ramos likely endorses the concept of fare-free buses, funded by taxes on
the wealthy – which is a position popular on the left. In the Senate,
she backed using new revenue (like from new taxes) to fund transit
improvements. As mayor, she would push the MTA and Albany to consider
eliminating bus fares citywide, since buses are disproportionately used
by low-income and immigrant New Yorkers. She’d frame it as an investment
in essential workers. So, it’s fair to say Ramos would <strong>support
making buses free for all</strong>, and would work to find the funding
(through, for example, congestion pricing revenue or a reallocation of
subsidies) to make it happen.</p>

the legislature he focused on housing and criminal justice, but he did
vote for increased MTA funding packages. Myrie’s district includes many
bus riders who struggle with fares. He would probably support at least
expanding Fair Fares (half-price) and continuing the free bus pilot. If
presented with a plan for zero-fare buses along with a solid funding
mechanism, Myrie would be inclined to back it as a matter of economic
and racial equity. He hasn’t independently championed free buses yet,
but as mayor, given that others in the race (like Lander, Mamdani) are
for it, Myrie would hardly oppose it. We can infer he’d <strong>favor
making buses free</strong> if it didn’t force cuts to service – meaning
he’d push the state or new taxes to cover the cost.</p>

ridership like all-door boarding, but not specifically free fares.
However, given his alignment with progressive policy and the fact that
the idea of free buses is now being piloted, Stringer would likely be
<strong>open to making buses free</strong> if the finances can be worked
out. He would certainly study its impact on ridership and traffic
(Stringer is known for data-driven policy). If evidence from the pilot
is positive, a Mayor Stringer would push to expand free service or
incorporate it in the next MTA funding agreement. He might propose a
modest tax or congestion pricing tweak to pay for it. Stringer’s overall
stance: <strong>supportive of fare-free buses</strong> as a way to
invest in working families, but with an eye on securing a sustainable

affordability for New Yorkers. Free transit would fit into his “True
Cost of Living” platform. While he hasn’t specifically said “free
buses,” he has emphasized guaranteed income and lower costs for
essentials. It’s plausible Blake would support the idea – especially
since it benefits the Bronx heavily (his home borough relies on buses).
As a moderate, he’d want to know how to fund it. He might suggest using
federal infrastructure money or public-private partnerships to subsidize
fares. Blake would probably favor <strong>expanding Fair Fares
first</strong> (maybe to full subsidy) as a step toward universal free
buses. If elected, he would at minimum continue the current free bus
pilot, and if it succeeds, he’d be inclined to <strong>broaden it to
more routes or boroughs</strong>, on the path to systemwide free buses.
He’d be cautious about budget impact but philosophically sees transit
access as key to equality.</p>

fare policy – he’s more focused on governance. He likely approaches free
buses pragmatically: does the benefit outweigh the lost revenue and how
to replace it? If presented evidence that free buses significantly speed
boarding and increase ridership without busting the budget, Walden might
support it, as he’s data-driven. But as an independent worried about
fiscal responsibility, he might be reluctant to promise citywide free
service funded by city taxes alone. Walden would perhaps prefer targeted
free transit (for students, seniors, low-income riders) rather than
universal. He might also advocate for the state to bear the cost if it
becomes policy. So Walden is <strong>not an ardent proponent of
completely free buses</strong>, but he isn’t ideologically opposed –
he’d weigh the idea carefully. Unless external funding was provided,
he’d likely hold off on full fare elimination, focusing instead on bus
improvements (like dedicated lanes) that improve service.</p>

market-oriented – he’d likely argue the ~$1.1 billion in annual bus fare
revenue is needed for operations or capital improvements. Tilson’s
priorities (crime, education, economy) do not include subsidizing
transit fares; rather, he’d probably put any available funds into
service upgrades (more buses, better maintenance) rather than free
rides. He believes in low taxes and might oppose a new tax to fund free
buses. Additionally, Tilson may worry free fares could encourage misuse
or crowding without clear benefit. So, he would <strong>oppose citywide
free buses</strong> paid by new taxes or diverting funds. He might
support more discounted fares for those in need (expand Fair Fares) as a
compromise. But overall, Tilson would argue to keep fares (maybe
implement congestion pricing to fund service improvements instead).</p>

he frequently criticizes fare evaders and even suggested that it leads
to disorder. Sliwa would view free fares as rewarding lawlessness (he
has an old-school view that everyone should pay their fare share). Also,
as a fiscal conservative, he wouldn’t approve raising taxes to fund free
transit for all. Sliwa instead proposes solutions like using restored
transit police to stop evasion, and perhaps providing fares in exchange
for community service for those who can’t pay. But
<strong>across-the-board free buses</strong> is not something Sliwa
would pursue. In fact, he’s more likely to advocate for rescinding the
recent free bus pilot, fearing it creates an expectation of “something
for nothing.” Sliwa’s stance: riders should pay a fare to support the

not make them free.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Ramos also is not interested in
shrinking government – she’s a pro-labor progressive who believes in
using government to uplift workers. She has criticized austerity and
fought against cuts to services like pre-K and CUNY. Ramos would oppose
broad spending cuts or layoffs. On taxes, she favors making the wealthy
and corporations pay more, not reducing their burden. She has, for
instance, supported higher income taxes on millionaires at the state
level. For small businesses, she’d rather provide direct assistance
(grants, commercial rent control) than across-the-board tax cuts. So
Ramos would <em>not</em> make it a goal to “ease the tax burden” on
businesses if that means less revenue for public programs. Instead,
she’d <strong>invest in public services</strong> – viewing them as
essential – and finance them by maintaining or raising taxes on the
rich. She’d only trim spending in areas she feels are bloated (maybe
NYPD OT or contracting costs) to redirect funds, not to reduce the size
of government.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Myrie, despite being somewhat more
moderate on housing development, is still a progressive Democrat when it
comes to the role of government. He is not campaigning on cutting city
services or taxes. He likely supports keeping city agencies adequately
funded to meet ambitious goals (like housing construction and
afterschool programs). Myrie might be open to finding efficiencies, but
any savings would probably go toward other public needs (e.g. funding
his Clean Slate implementation or mental health services) rather than
tax cuts. He hasn’t signaled any desire to reduce business taxes – if
anything, he’s mentioned making sure the wealthy contribute to
solutions. So we can say Myrie <strong>would not prioritize shrinking
city government</strong>; he’d maintain or enhance its capacity to
deliver housing, education, etc. If there’s an opportunity to relieve
small homeowners or mom-and-pop businesses of some fees or fines, he
might do that, but widespread tax reduction isn’t his platform.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> As a democratic socialist, Mamdani
firmly believes in <em>expanding</em> the social safety net and public
sector, not shrinking it. He advocates for rent control, free transit,
public housing – all of which involve a strong government role and
spending. Mamdani would likely seek to <strong>raise taxes on the rich
and corporations</strong> to fund new programs. Cutting spending to ease
burdens on businesses goes against his ideology; he’d rather those with
wealth pay more to relieve burdens on the poor (via free services). He
has explicitly campaigned on a $30 minimum wage, which businesses
vehemently oppose – indicating he’s not looking to lighten business
costs generally. Mamdani would resist any austerity measures. He’d
probably grow certain city departments (e.g. housing, social services)
to implement his policies. In summary, Mamdani has <strong>no interest
in shrinking city gov or cutting business taxes</strong> – if anything,
he’d shrink the NYPD budget to reallocate funds, but overall city
spending would increase under him due to big social investments (paid
for by taxing the wealthy) (<a class="underline hover:text-blue-600"

Lander Wants to be Mayor - Will New Yorker’s Vote for Change? - Queens

bloated contracts or consultant fees. However, Stringer does
<em>not</em> support cutting core services or weakening labor
protections to shrink government. He is pro-union and pro-public
investment (for instance, he wanted to hire thousands more early
childhood educators and build housing). To fund those, he suggested
measures like ending unnecessary tax breaks for developers. As for
easing taxes on businesses, Stringer might back targeted relief for
small businesses (like reducing fines or simplifying regulations), but
he would likely <strong>maintain the overall tax structure</strong> –
possibly pushing state-level reform of property taxes to make them more
equitable, not simply lower. In short, Stringer would present himself as
a <strong>fiscally responsible progressive</strong>: cut inefficiencies
and use the savings to fund new programs, rather than broad tax cuts. He
wouldn’t aim to shrink the public workforce substantially or slash
public spending, aside from areas he deems wasteful or corrupt.</p>

making life more affordable through government action (guaranteed
income, childcare support). He isn’t advocating shrinking government;
rather, he emphasizes better management and directing resources to those
who need them. As a former small business owner liaison under Obama,
Blake does care about helping businesses – but through initiatives like
easier access to capital and city procurement opportunities, not
necessarily tax cuts. He would not be inclined to cut city spending on
social programs in order to lower business taxes. Blake might support
some tax incentive programs if they are tied to job creation in
underserved communities, but he’d also want to ensure the budget can
fund his social proposals. So Blake would <strong>keep government
strong</strong> to deliver services, and focus on growth (investing in
job training, etc.) to broaden the tax base rather than shrinking
government and taxes. He’s more about smart spending than cutting
spending.</p>

helps keep businesses (and high-income individuals) from leaving. He
might not slash major revenue sources, but he could propose targeted tax
cuts or fee reductions to spur business activity and goodwill. Overall,
Walden is inclined to <strong>reduce the size and cost of city
government</strong> if it can be done without harming services – for
instance, cutting middle management layers, merging redundant offices,
ending pet projects. Any truly essential services, he’d maintain, but
he’d proudly shrink the bureaucracy and use the savings to either lower

certain offices he deems unnecessary (he mentioned the ThriveNYC mental

Sliwa asserts that high taxes are driving people out, so he’d push to
<strong>lower property taxes</strong> for homeowners and perhaps
rollback some recent business regulations/fines to reduce costs. He even
suggested selling off unused city property to raise revenue and avoid
taxes. Sliwa’s government would likely see layoffs of what he calls
“paper-pushers” in administrative roles, and a crackdown on overtime
abuse. He’d keep frontline workers like cops and sanitation, but cut
middle managers. All to <strong>ease the burden on taxpayers and

orthodoxy: smaller government, lower taxes to spur growth. So one can

That implies he might support stronger interventions. If progressives
like Lander and Ramos have come around to accept involuntary treatment
in some cases, Myrie likely is on the same page. He would demand that
due process and proper medical protocols are followed, but would not
rule it out. He co-sponsored (and celebrated) the passing of the
“Treatment Not Jail Act” in the Senate to divert mentally ill offenders
into treatment instead of jail – showing he favors treatment, even if
court-mandated, over neglect or incarceration. So, Myrie would probably
<strong>support mandated treatment for those with serious mental illness
who won’t accept help</strong>, provided housing and support follow.
He’d ensure the city expands psychiatric care capacity to handle this

coercive approach. The DSA stance tends to emphasize voluntary,
community-based care and tackling root causes (housing, poverty) rather
than forced treatment. Mamdani hasn’t spoken at length on this specific,
but given his ideology, he would focus on building trust with homeless
individuals via peer counselors and offering voluntary safe havens and
on-site psychiatric services. He probably believes that involuntary
commitment could deter people from seeking any help for fear of being
locked up. Expect Mamdani to push for <em>Housing First</em> (give
people housing without preconditions) and harm reduction approaches. So
he would <strong>oppose broad mandates of treatment</strong> and instead
invest in making help so accessible and attractive that people accept
it. In extreme cases (threat of violence, etc.), current law already
allows intervention – he wouldn’t expand it. In summary, Mamdani would
not continue Adams’ policy; he’d end or greatly limit involuntary
removals, favoring <strong>voluntary, consent-based treatment
only</strong>.</p>

Stringer likely supports <strong>using Kendra’s Law (court-ordered
treatment)</strong> for those who are a danger or utterly unable to care
for themselves, as a necessary measure – quietly aligning with the
recent moderate consensus. In 2021, his mental health platform included
expanding mobile crisis teams and supportive housing; he did not focus
on involuntary commitment, but he didn’t oppose Kendra’s Law either
(which was strengthened in 2021 at the state level). So as mayor,
Stringer would <em>continue</em> mandated treatment in limited cases but
ensure it’s done judiciously. He’d also invest heavily in preventive
outreach so fewer people get to that point. Essentially,
<strong>Stringer would allow involuntary hospitalization as a last
resort</strong> (rather than categorically rejecting it), but he would
surround it with oversight and try to minimize its use by bolstering
voluntary services.</p>

compassionate approach heavy on persuasion, but if someone is clearly
mentally incapable and in danger, he’d support intervention. As an
ordained minister, he’s spoken about caring for those in crisis, and he
supported the “Treatment Not Jails” philosophy. Blake would probably be
<strong>amenable to mandated treatment</strong> under specific
circumstances – he often emphasizes doing what’s necessary to protect
vulnerable people. He’d also push for more Black and brown mental health
professionals doing outreach to build trust (culturally competent care),
hoping to reduce refusal rates. But in truly severe cases, Blake would
not leave a person on the street in psychosis; he’d authorize clinicians
to commit them for treatment. So, expect Blake to continue the
<strong>policy of involuntary help for severe mental illness</strong>,
but with an emphasis on monitoring outcomes and ensuring it transitions
to long-term supportive housing or care.</p>

self-described problem-solver, is likely <strong>strongly in favor of
mandating treatment</strong> for those who need it. He sees the
humanitarian crisis of mentally ill homeless as something that requires
decisive action. Walden has spoken about “doing the tough but right
things” – this would align with that. He would probably criticize
previous leaders for <em>not</em> using Kendra’s Law enough. Walden
would streamline the process for involuntary commitment to cut through
red tape (while still following legal standards). At the same time, he’d
push Albany to add psych beds (since lack of capacity often prevents
holding people for treatment). In sum, Walden would <strong>robustly use
involuntary hospitalization and mandated treatment</strong> to get
seriously ill individuals off the streets and into care, and he’d pride
himself on cutting through bureaucracy to make sure it’s done
effectively (and legally).</p>

Adams’ approach, if not wanting to go further. He has a very data-driven
and, some might say, hard-nosed stance on quality-of-life issues. He has
lamented that letting mentally ill people wander the streets is neither
compassionate nor safe. He’d favor empowering professionals (and police,
if needed) to <strong>compel treatment for those who refuse</strong> yet
clearly need it. Tilson has also written extensively on addiction and
interventions – he tends to back tough-love solutions. He might explore
court-ordered conservatorships for the gravely disabled (like some
states use). He also would invest in more psychiatric facilities to have
a place to bring people. So expect Tilson to be a <strong>strong
proponent of mandated treatment</strong> for the homeless mentally ill
who won’t voluntarily accept help, framing it as restoring dignity and
safety. He’d likely find funding for many more mental health beds to
make this feasible, and consider it a priority to remove these
individuals from public spaces into care.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Sliwa has long argued for a more
forceful approach to the homeless mentally ill. He absolutely supports
<strong>mandating treatment and confinement</strong> if necessary. He
often recounts stories of EDPs (emotionally disturbed persons) causing
harm and criticizes “liberal” officials for allowing them to remain on
the streets. In his 2021 campaign, he proposed reopening state
psychiatric hospitals and sending mentally ill homeless there for
treatment, even if against their will. Sliwa would coordinate with the
NYPD and mental health workers to sweep subways and streets of anyone
clearly disturbed and get them into institutions. He might even push for
changes in state law to make commitment easier (lowering the “imminent
danger” standard). So, Sliwa’s stance is unequivocal: <strong>if someone
is mentally ill and living on the street, and refuses help, they should
be taken in for treatment regardless of consent</strong>. He’d portray
it as common-sense compassion and public safety. This is very much
aligned with his law-and-order persona.</p>

programs to convert distressed hotels and office buildings into housing
(especially after COVID hit and offices emptied). He’s on record saying
we need to “repurpose vacant commercial space for housing.” If mayor,
Cuomo would use his Albany clout to push through any state law changes
needed to legalize basement units (a bill to allow NYC an ADU pilot
failed previously – he could help get it passed). He would direct city
agencies to streamline conversion permits and perhaps offer incentives
for office landlords to convert to apartments. Cuomo is all about big
goals and meeting them – legalizing ADUs and conversions aligns with his
housing production aims. Therefore, expect Cuomo to <strong>aggressively
pursue legalizing basement apartments</strong> (with safety regulations)
and <strong>converting offices/hotels to residential</strong>, cutting
through red tape to do so. It fits his moderate, results-oriented brand

bring basements up to code and rent them legally. He was disappointed
that broader ADU legalization stalled. As mayor, Lander would be
<em>very</em> supportive of <strong>legalizing and converting basements
to safe housing</strong> – it aligns with his housing affordability
mission and helps small homeowners. He’d likely allocate city funds or
low-interest loans to help retrofits (as he did via the pilot). On
offices, Lander supports conversions too – he recognizes post-pandemic,
vacant offices can become apartments. He would ensure some affordability
or community benefit as part of conversions (maybe relaxed zoning if
some units are affordable). But overall, Lander would <strong>fast-track
ADU legalization and office-to-housing conversions</strong> as key
strategies. He even touted in his platform the need to convert “empty

homeowners have illegal basement units and need a path to legalization

apartments should be made safe <em>and</em> legal rather than vacated,
as they’re an important source of affordable housing. So as mayor, Ramos
would push aggressively for <strong>legalizing basement and cellar
apartments</strong>, working with Albany to change codes and providing
city technical assistance to homeowners. Regarding office conversions,
with her pro-labor bent, she’d like to see old office buildings in
Manhattan turned into residential use that includes affordable units and
union construction jobs. She would support zoning changes and perhaps
tax breaks conditioned on some affordable housing outcome. In summary,

who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 - City &amp; State New
York</a>). Brooklyn (his borough) has many basement units that are
unofficial; he’d want them legalized for safety and to count toward
housing goals. He likely would work with the state on an ADU
legalization law (which he probably voted for in the Senate when it was
proposed). On offices, Myrie’s million-unit plan explicitly counts on
rezonings and conversions of underused commercial space (<a class="underline hover:text-blue-600"

who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 - City &amp; State New
York</a>). So he is fully in favor. Myrie as mayor would
<strong>prioritize implementing the regulatory changes</strong> needed
to open up basements, garages, and empty offices for housing use, doing
so in a way that keeps tenants safe (he’d recall the basement flooding
deaths and push for mitigation measures as part of legalization). He
might also tie in energy retrofitting (converting offices could be
paired with green upgrades). But the bottom line is Myrie would see
<strong>ADU legalization and office-to-housing as essential to meeting
his huge housing target</strong>, so he’d push it zealously.</p>

                        <h4 class="font-bold">Zohran Mamdani:</h4>
                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Mamdani is likely very supportive
of converting unused space into housing, as it aligns with his urgency
on the housing crisis. He has spoken about the absurdity of high vacancy
rates in Midtown offices while people lack homes. He would
<strong>absolutely legalize basement apartments</strong> – this is a
common cause among NYC progressives and DSA (housing more people without
new construction, often helping immigrant families). Mamdani’s district
(Queens) includes many informal basement dwellings; he’d legitimize
them. He might also weave in a plan to turn city-owned vacant lots or
buildings into social housing. For offices, Mamdani would support
conversion as long as it results in <em>affordable</em> housing – he
might, for example, advocate using city funds or land banks to acquire
empty office buildings and convert them into mixed-income housing rather
than leaving it purely to luxury developers. In summary, Mamdani would
<strong>push to unlock every possible space for housing</strong> – from
basements to offices – viewing it as low-hanging fruit in expanding
supply. He’d ensure strong tenant protections and affordability in the
process (so it’s not just market-rate lofts).</p>

                        <h4 class="font-bold">Scott Stringer:</h4>
                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Stringer has a record of proposing
granular housing solutions like these. He called for legalizing ADUs
(including basement units) during his 2021 campaign as a way to add
affordable housing <em>and</em> help small homeowners with rental
income. As Comptroller, he even released a report on the potential of
basement apartments in alleviating the housing crunch. So he is a big
proponent of <strong>bringing basement/attic apartments up to code and
legalizing them</strong>. He would dedicate resources to an inter-agency
task force to streamline the permitting and waive certain zoning
requirements to make this feasible in neighborhoods citywide. For office
conversions, Stringer advocated using surplus commercial space to create
housing, especially affordable and senior housing. He might create a
public-private fund to buy outdated office buildings and convert them.
Thus, a Stringer administration would <strong>aggressively pursue ADU
legalization and office-to-residential conversion</strong> as key
strategies to boost housing supply relatively quickly. He’d do it with
an eye on safety (inspections, fire code upgrades) and likely push
Albany if laws need changing.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Blake would be supportive of any and
all above approaches to add housing stock. He talks about a
“Mitchell-Lama 2.0” which primarily means building new, but converting
existing buildings fits too. As a Bronx native, he knows many
multi-family homes have illegal basement units – he’d support making it
easier for those to become legal, both to protect tenants and help
homeowners. Blake would work with communities to allay concerns (some
homeowners fear increased taxes or penalties if they legalize a basement
– he’d likely include tax abatements or amnesty to encourage them). On
office conversions, he’d see an opportunity for jobs and housing – he’d
likely ensure MWBE (minority/women business) contractors are involved in
conversions, aligning with his focus on equity. In short, Blake would
<strong>greenlight basement apartment legalization and expedite office
conversions</strong> as part of his affordable housing and economic
empowerment agenda. There’s little controversy for him there, aside from
finding funds to help with renovations, which he’d consider well worth
it.</p>

who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 - City &amp; State New
York</a>) – precisely what ADU legalization and office conversions
entail. As an attorney, Walden likely understands the legal/regulatory
barriers intimately and would seek to remove them. He might streamline
the permitting process at DOB (Department of Buildings) to make
conversions quicker (like self-certification for simpler basement
conversions, etc.). He might also offer incentives: e.g. waive
conversion fees or provide low-interest rehab loans. Walden would view
<strong>legalizing basement units</strong> as a no-brainer to add
affordable rentals and <strong>converting offices</strong> as a smart
way to revitalize business districts and add housing. He’d use his
independent status to broker deals with state lawmakers (since ADUs
require state law changes) – possibly suing the state if needed to let
NYC pilot ADU legalization (though likely he’d just lobby). So expect
Walden to be <strong>fully on board and moving fast on these
conversions</strong> to demonstrate early progress in office.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Tilson, as a housing investor by
background, absolutely supports reducing regulatory barriers to new
housing forms. He has commented on zoning and NIMBYism being obstacles
to affordability. Tilson would <strong>support ADU legalization
(basements, garage apartments)</strong> because it increases supply
without public spending, aligning with his market-based approach. He’d
also strongly back converting underused offices to housing – in fact he
has likely written about how remote work opens an opportunity for
housing in city centers. He would push to make the conversion process as
<strong>“by-right” as possible</strong> – meaning, if a building meets
basic criteria, it can convert to residential without discretionary
approvals that drag on. He might also champion updating building codes
to facilitate such conversions (maybe more flexible light/air
requirements for ADUs, etc.). So, in summary, Tilson would
<strong>aggressively legalize and streamline basement apartment and
office conversions</strong>, seeing it as a win-win for increasing
housing and aiding property owners to repurpose assets. He’d, however,
oppose onerous affordability requirements on these conversions
(preferring them to be market-rate, to encourage participation).</p>

                        <h4 class="font-bold">Curtis Sliwa:</h4>
                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Sliwa likely supports basement
apartment legalization and office conversions as practical measures –
but with caveats. He is very attuned to quality-of-life issues, so he’d
insist that basement units meet safety standards to avoid tragedies or
overcrowding. Given his focus on outer-borough homeowners (he’s courted
them as a constituency), he’d love to give them the ability to rent a
legal basement unit – he’d frame it as helping working-class homeowners
stay afloat and providing low-cost housing. So he would <strong>legalize
basement apartments</strong> citywide, paired with strict enforcement of
safety upgrades (he might even have the Guardian Angels volunteer to
check smoke detectors, etc. – very on brand for him). On office
conversions, Sliwa would support them particularly if they create
housing for groups he cares about (like veterans, whom he often
mentions). He might prioritize converting hotels/office buildings into
housing for homeless or mentally ill (he’s suggested using a closed
prison or Creedmoor hospital building to house migrants and homeless).
So Sliwa is <strong>in favor of turning any suitable space into
housing</strong> quickly – though he’d emphasize using it for
<strong>supportive and affordable housing</strong> to address
homelessness, rather than luxury development. He’d cut red tape to do
it, possibly even use emergency orders if he could justify it. So yes on
ADUs and conversions, under a Sliwa administration.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Adams’ tenure has clearly prioritized
bolstering police ranks and enforcement over new reforms. A former NYPD
captain, Adams believes the department had already been reformed
significantly (especially post-2020) and now needs support to do its
job. While he did retain the DOI and CCRB oversight structures, he has
not pursued additional police accountability measures as mayor. In fact,
he brought back a modified anti-gun unit and fought against the City
Council’s attempt to ban qualified immunity (which passed before he took
office) – he was lukewarm on some of those reforms. Adams often says he
holds officers to high standards but publicly stands by them (for
example, he defended officers in several controversial incidents). Under
him, the NYPD’s disciplinary matrix continues but there haven’t been
major new reform initiatives. So Adams is clearly <strong>more focused
on adding officers and proactive policing than on expanding
oversight</strong> (<a class="underline hover:text-blue-600"

New York City mayoral election - Wikipedia</a>). He did not make police
accountability a top talking point in his re-election pitch; instead, he
talks about crime declines. In sum, Adams is <em>not</em> prioritizing
new reform measures – he feels existing accountability (like bodycams,
CCRB) is sufficient and now the focus must be on crime reduction.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Cuomo’s emphasis in this race is on
restoring public order, not on police reform. As governor, he did enact
some reforms after George Floyd’s murder (like signing the repeal of
Civil Rights Law 50-a to open police disciplinary records, and requiring
local departments to have reform plans), but he also criticized elements
of 2020’s bail reform and has positioned himself as tougher on crime
than the “left.” Cuomo tends to see the NYPD as a necessary force that
should be well-managed, but he hasn’t been an outspoken advocate of
things like defunding or radically changing police practices. He would
likely maintain existing accountability structures (CCRB, IG, etc.) but
wouldn’t initiate new major reforms such as reducing qualified immunity
or ending broken-windows policing. In fact, he might reverse some
reforms he thinks went too far (he’s hinted bail reform needs tweaks).
Cuomo is running to the right of Adams on crime, effectively, so
<strong>he would prioritize strong policing over new oversight
measures</strong>. He’d ensure police misconduct is addressed (he
doesn’t want abusive cops running loose), but that would not overshadow
his drive to empower cops to do their job. Essentially, expect a Cuomo
mayoralty to focus on <strong>competent policing with existing
accountability</strong>, rather than pursuing new reform
initiatives.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Lander has been one of the city’s
leading voices for police reform and accountability (especially during
his time on the Council). He co-founded the Council’s Progressive Caucus
and pushed for the POST Act (surveillance oversight) and the Diaphragm
Compression ban in the NYPD. He frequently clashed with the Adams
administration on budget cuts vs. police funding. However,
interestingly, Lander’s mayoral platform has balanced that by
acknowledging safety concerns (even supporting more officers – see issue
1). But fundamentally, Lander’s heart is in accountability: he wants a
<strong>police department that is held to the highest
standards</strong>. He’d prioritize strengthening the CCRB (maybe giving
it final say on discipline), increasing transparency (perhaps codifying
the public release of bodycam footage, etc.), and shifting certain
duties (traffic enforcement, mental health response) away from NYPD to
civilian agencies – which is a form of reform. Compared to “hire more
cops,” Lander clearly places more emphasis on <strong>police reform and
oversight</strong> (though he doesn’t ignore staffing, as noted). He
believes trust in police is built through accountability. So as mayor,
Lander would implement additional training, robust misconduct
prosecution, potentially end qualified immunity at the city level (the
Council already did for NYPD officers, which he supported). In short,
<strong>Lander would strongly prioritize police reform &amp;
accountability</strong>, even as he ensures adequate NYPD staffing –
making him quite distinct from Adams on that front.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Ramos is an outspoken advocate for
police accountability. In the Senate, she supported the repeal of 50-a,
the Special Prosecutor law for police killings, and other reform
legislation after 2020. She has often criticized over-policing in
communities of color and is aligned with the view that resources should
go to community services over expanding the NYPD. As mayor, Ramos would
<strong>prioritize reforming the NYPD culture and practices</strong> –
for instance, strengthening de-escalation training, penalizing officers
for misconduct (she’d work closely with CCRB and likely expand its
powers), and ending what she sees as abusive practices like excessive
subway sweeps. She likely supports reallocating certain responsibilities
from NYPD to civilian agencies (e.g. mental health crisis response,
traffic enforcement). Compared to hiring more cops, Ramos would far
rather <strong>invest in accountability measures and alternative
responders</strong>. She would not increase the NYPD headcount; if
anything, she might slightly reduce it and redirect funding to
prevention programs. So yes – <strong>police reform and oversight would
be a top priority</strong> under Ramos, more so than boosting numbers.
She’d focus on bias training, demilitarizing the police, and ensuring
officers who abuse power are disciplined or removed.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Myrie has a foot in both worlds. He
comes from a community impacted by both crime and over-policing. In
Albany he backed the major 2020 reform laws (like banning chokeholds,
making police disciplinary records public). He also pushed the Clean
Slate Act for sealing criminal records, showing his focus on second
chances and systemic justice. While running for mayor, he hasn’t
hammered police reform (the race narrative is more about his housing
plan), but one can infer that he’d still <strong>emphasize
accountability</strong>. He would certainly maintain the reforms already
enacted and resist any rollback. He would support continuing things like
the DOI’s oversight of NYPD, and likely appoint reform-minded
individuals to the CCRB and police commissioner post. On hiring, Myrie
hasn’t advocated for more cops – he’s more about using resources
differently (e.g. youth programs for prevention). So he’d put a higher
priority on <strong>curbing abusive practices and enhancing
oversight</strong> than on recruiting new officers. He’d want improved
community-police relations via accountability. So expect Myrie to lean
toward the <strong>reform side</strong>: ensuring the NYPD complies with
disciplinary standards, perhaps expanding the “Duty to Intervene” rules,
and focusing on constitutional policing rather than increasing the force
size.</p>

<strong>police reform (indeed, transformation) over expansion</strong>.
Being a democratic socialist, he has been critical of the NYPD’s size
and budget. He likely supports ideas like reallocating some police
funding to social services (“defund” in the sense of reassigning tasks).
He would prioritize strong accountability: enforcing the recently passed
NYPD disciplinary matrix, empowering the CCRB further (maybe giving CCRB
final disciplinary authority rather than the Police Commissioner), and
ending policies he sees as criminalizing poverty (subway fare
enforcement, for example). Mamdani probably backs reducing the role of
police in issues like mental health, traffic, schools (he’d likely
remove NYPD from schools in favor of counselors). So as mayor, Mamdani’s
priority would be <strong>police reform and robust civilian
oversight</strong>. He would not hire more officers; if anything, he’d
shrink the NYPD over time through attrition and shift those resources to
community programs. Stopping abuses – like brutality, improper
surveillance of Muslim communities (something he’s vocal about) – would
be central. In short, Mamdani would <strong>put reform and
accountability first, and would not prioritize increasing officer
count</strong> (he’d argue better policing comes from accountability and
community investment, not more cops).</p>

moving school safety out of NYPD). If mayor, Stringer would likely
<strong>emphasize continuing the reform momentum</strong> – for
instance, fully implementing the chokehold ban, the disciplinary matrix,

strengthening the CCRB (possibly giving CCRB increased budget or
subpoena power). While he did say he’d “beef up the NYPD” in terms of

trust in police – which means accountability. He’s spoken about being a
Black man who has experienced both sides of policing. In his campaign,
he emphasizes making government work for all, which in policing terms
means ensuring NYPD treats all communities fairly. Blake championed
Raise the Age (which diverted 16-17 year olds from adult courts) –
showing a focus on juvenile justice reform. As mayor, he’d likely
support measures like expanding implicit bias training, tracking and
publishing data on police stops and use of force, and strengthening the
CCRB. He might also promote hiring more officers of color, but that’s a
hiring aspect aligned with reform (changing NYPD culture). He’s not
going to be for pumping up police ranks without addressing reform – he’d
consider that counterproductive. So Blake would <strong>prioritize
police accountability and reform</strong> (e.g. ensuring officers who
commit misconduct face consequences, improving police-community

lawfulness of the enforcers. He’s positioned himself as someone who will
root out corruption anywhere – including in the NYPD. He notably
represented clients against the city in some cases (e.g., NYCHA tenants,
etc.), so he’s not afraid to challenge city agencies. Walden would
likely want an NYPD that is both effective and accountable. He might
propose to beef up the Internal Affairs Bureau or give more funding to
CCRB to speed up investigations. That said, if forced to choose, Walden
might lean toward giving cops the tools to fight crime (hiring, etc.)
<em>while</em> promising to hold them accountable – trying to do both.
But his campaign statements suggest a <strong>focus on making sure city
institutions are not corrupt or abusive</strong> (<a class="underline hover:text-blue-600"

who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 - City &amp; State New
York</a>). For example, he would likely be very aggressive on breaking
up any ticket-fixing or tow corruption or gang evidence planting
scandals – those would outrage him as a rule-of-law guy. So he’d
prioritize <strong>accountability – “cleaning up” the NYPD’s bad apples
and bad practices</strong> – believing that will improve performance.
Hiring more officers would be secondary; he’d first aim to maximize the
integrity and efficiency of the current force. Walden’s emphasis on
anti-corruption and good governance indicates <strong>he’d put a lot of
weight on NYPD reform/oversight</strong>.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Tilson’s priority is on outcomes –
he wants crime down. He likely sees some of the post-2020 reforms as
having gone too far, but he also expects professional conduct from
police. Tilson is a big data, metrics guy: he would demand NYPD produce
metrics on misconduct and he’d act on them. However, if asked to
prioritize, he’d probably say <strong>fight crime first, while
maintaining necessary oversight</strong>. He would not focus on new
reforms – he’d say implement the ones passed in 2020 and move on. Tilson
would oppose anything he sees as “handcuffing police” overly (he was
critical of talk to remove qualified immunity, etc.). So in practice,
he’d emphasize <strong>supporting the NYPD to do proactive
policing</strong> to curb crime (hiring more cops, bringing back
plainclothes units) and say that current accountability mechanisms
(bodycams, CCRB) are sufficient when properly managed (<a class="underline hover:text-blue-600"

cops readily if proven misconduct – but he wouldn’t make reform a

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Sliwa is firmly on the side of
<strong>empowering police over imposing further reforms</strong>. He has
been a vocal critic of what he calls “political correctness” hampering
police. Sliwa would try to roll back some reforms if possible – for
instance, he’d likely loosen the diaphragm compression ban, push to end
the federal monitorship of the NYPD from the stop-and-frisk case, and
reduce the influence of the CCRB. He often says the police have been
“demonized” and he wants to “let them do their job.” Sliwa would almost
certainly <em>increase</em> discretionary arrests for low-level offenses
(reversing shifts away from that) and protect cops from what he sees as
unfair punishment for split-second decisions. That implies he’d
<strong>de-prioritize external oversight</strong>. He even suggested
recruiting retired cops to oversee precincts instead of CCRB civilians.
So clearly, Sliwa’s priority is <em>not</em> police reform – it’s giving
police free rein to enforce laws. He would defund or diminish some
oversight entities if he could (though many are mandated by law).
Sliwa’s stance: <strong>hire more cops, crack down on crime, don’t
hamstring police with new regulations</strong>. Accountability would be
mostly internal (he trusts NYPD to police itself more than he trusts
“civilian activists”). In summary, Sliwa would <strong>prioritize
strengthening police presence and powers over reform measures</strong>,
likely reversing some accountability measures he thinks go too far.</p>

businesses and developments. He celebrated the completion of the new
Belmont Park Islanders arena and the coming soccer stadium in Queens. He
has actively courted corporate employers: he traveled to Florida to urge
finance companies to return to NYC offices, and met with tech CEOs.
Adams is worried about companies relocating to low-tax states and has
said NYC must be pro-business to keep jobs. He supported efforts to get
a casino in NYC (which is now moving forward – he’s specifically backed
a casino resort in Times Square or Coney Island with community
benefits). Adams often touts job growth and major projects as wins (<a class="underline hover:text-blue-600"

He also signaled he would have handled the Amazon HQ2 differently
(implying he’d have kept them on board). So Adams clearly
<strong>prioritizes attracting big businesses and development</strong> –
he frames it as creating jobs for New Yorkers. He’s likely to offer
incentives or streamline approvals for major investors (within reason;
he might not give away as much as some states do, but he’s open to
public-private deals). In short, Adams wants NYC to be seen as “open for
business” and would rather strike a deal with a stadium or corporate HQ
(ensuring some benefits) than see them go elsewhere. This aligns with
his pro-business Democrat branding.</p>

new downstate casinos and try to shape where they go (ensuring NYC gets
at least one prime location). He’d also be aggressive in pitching NYC to
companies in states with controversial laws, inviting them to relocate
here (similar to his past campaigns inviting businesses from, say,
Texas, after anti-abortion laws). So expect Cuomo to <strong>actively
court major businesses and developments</strong>. He’d offer tax
incentives if needed (though he’d try to structure them to show net

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Lander’s approach to development is
more community-centric. He opposed the Amazon HQ2 deal’s secrecy/lack of
community input, though he wasn’t against Amazon per se – he just wanted
conditions (like union jobs, local hiring, affordable housing) and
transparency. Lander is <em>not</em> anti-business, but he doesn’t
believe in blank-check incentives for megacorps. He’d prefer to support
small businesses and startups rather than shower subsidies on a
trillion-dollar company. That said, Lander knows a strong economy funds
progressive programs. So he would try to accommodate big projects
<em>with strong community benefits</em>. For example, he supported the
Gowanus rezoning because it included affordable housing and
environmental remediation, but he would oppose something like the NYCFC
stadium if it lacked community investments (however, he actually did not
oppose the soccer stadium – he was fairly quiet, and it moved with union
support). For casinos or stadiums, Lander would insist on thorough
review and benefits agreements (e.g. he might accept a casino if it
comes with funding for transit or social programs). In summary, Lander
would <strong>negotiate hard with large businesses</strong> – he won’t
bend over backward with huge tax breaks, but he wouldn’t summarily
reject major developments either. He’d aim for a balanced approach:
welcome businesses that invest in New Yorkers and abide by labor
standards, but be willing to say no to deals that only enrich
developers. So he’d attract big business <em>on his terms</em>.</p>

who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 - City &amp; State New
York</a>). She’s not anti-job – she fights for good jobs and union labor
– but she doesn’t trust backroom deals with billionaires. As mayor,
Ramos would <strong>not prioritize wooing huge corporations with special
treatment</strong>. She’d focus on cultivating local small businesses,
cooperatives, and improving infrastructure to make NYC broadly
attractive. If a major company wants to come here, she’d involve the
community in shaping the deal (schools, transit improvements, etc. as
part of it). So one could say she’d rather “grow from within” than lure
an Amazon with $3B in incentives. She’s okay with development
<em>if</em> it centers community voices. But Ramos would likely
<strong>risk big projects leaving</strong> if they demand too much or
don’t align with equity goals – she’d prefer that to a bad deal.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Myrie is somewhat more moderate than
Ramos on development. He hasn’t opposed all big projects – for instance,
he’s supportive of the Atlantic Yards (now Barclays Center) so long as
promised affordable housing is delivered. He was part of negotiations in
Albany to legalize downstate casinos (which he supported because of
potential jobs and revenue). Myrie’s approach is pragmatic: he will
engage large businesses, but with firm conditions for local hiring,
affordable housing contributions, etc. He wants that “competent
management” image, which likely includes working smoothly with business
interests. So he would <strong>welcome large businesses and
projects</strong>, but ensure they partner with communities. He
supported the Idea of a “NYC Recovery Compact” where businesses pledge
to invest in the city. So Myrie wouldn’t throw huge blank checks at
companies, but he’d find creative ways to entice them (e.g. streamlined
permitting, tax credits tied to job creation). Losing jobs to another
city is something he’d try to avoid. Expect him to <strong>work to
attract major developments</strong> as long as they further policy goals
(like requiring a stadium or HQ to adhere to labor standards and include
community benefits). In contrast to Ramos, Myrie might have been more
amenable to re-negotiating with Amazon rather than celebrating their
exit.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Mamdani would be very critical of
prioritizing big corporations. He famously was part of the Queens left
movement that opposed Amazon HQ2. He believes public resources should go
to social housing, not billionaire corporations. Mamdani’s focus is on
strengthening working-class power – he’d likely support unionization
efforts at Amazon and such, rather than giving Amazon subsidies. So as
mayor, Mamdani would <strong>not prioritize attracting huge corporate
projects</strong> like casinos or luxury developments. In fact, he might
actively oppose some – for example, he’d likely oppose a casino in
working-class Queens if residents are against it. He would prefer using
city land for affordable housing, not stadiums (unless it’s
community-driven). Mamdani might be okay with <em>some</em> major
projects if they are publicly owned or community-controlled (imagine a
publicly owned solar manufacturing plant or something). But
corporate-led projects expecting tax breaks? He’d say no – if they want
NYC’s market, they can come on our terms (pay taxes, pay living wages).
So he would <strong>risk companies leaving rather than compromise on his
principles</strong>. He’d invest city funds in cooperatives, public
works, and small businesses instead of courting big corporations.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Stringer has tried to balance
pro-business and progressive stances. As Manhattan BP and Comptroller,
he had to engage with big real estate and corporate interests, and he
did so while also pushing for affordable housing and community benefits.
He criticized the Amazon HQ2 secrecy but said he wasn’t against Amazon
coming if done right. He likely would have preferred a more transparent
negotiation with community input rather than outright rejection. So as
mayor, Stringer would <strong>work to retain and attract large
businesses</strong>, but he’d aim for smart deals (no blank check
subsidies, but possibly targeted incentives). He knows the city needs a
strong tax base. He would also focus on reforms like fixing the property
tax system to make NYC more attractive to commercial tenants (he’s
spoken about commercial rent tax reforms, etc.). For developments like
stadiums or casinos, he’d follow the ULURP process and push for maximum
community benefit, but ultimately he’s not anti-development. He
supported Hudson Yards initially (though later criticized its
financing). So expect <strong>Stringer to try to keep big employers and
projects in NYC</strong> through negotiation and balanced incentive
packages. He’d probably convene an economic development summit with
business leaders to find out what they need and what the city needs from
them. In summary, he’d lean towards <strong>attracting and retaining big
business</strong> (albeit with conditions) rather than risk them
leaving.</p>

moderate in some respects – he worked in the Obama White House Office of
Public Engagement where interacting with business was key. He also is
deeply focused on minority-owned business development. Blake would
likely see major developments as opportunities to create jobs for
communities of color if handled properly (ensuring minority contractors
and hiring). He’d be inclined to welcome corporate investments in NYC.
He often talks about public-private partnerships. So he would
<strong>encourage big companies to set up in NYC</strong>, but emphasize
diversity and community uplift in those deals. For example, if a stadium
is built, he’d fight to ensure local youth programs are funded by it. If
a tech HQ comes, he’d want pipelines for Bronx kids into tech jobs. He’s
not keen on giving away huge tax abatements (he didn’t directly weigh in
on Amazon HQ2, but as a Bronx politician he probably sympathized with
Queens officials who felt left out of talks). Still, he wouldn’t want to
turn down tens of thousands of jobs. So Blake would try to
<strong>strike balanced agreements to attract big projects</strong> –
he’s risk-averse about losing them because he’s seen how jobs leaving
hurt the Bronx historically. His stance would be: bring development, but
do it equitably.</p>

Walden would aggressively pitch NYC to big companies (perhaps offering

might also think he can negotiate a better bargain for the city in such
deals. Expect Walden to <strong>court large employers and
developers</strong>, promising a competent, non-ideological approach to
get deals done. Casinos, stadiums – he’d evaluate them case by case, but
generally if the numbers show net benefit, he’d support them. He
specifically alludes to being like Bloomberg who was very
development-friendly. So Walden would <strong>prioritize
attracting/keeping large businesses</strong> and not worry too much

who’s running for New York City mayor in 2025 - City &amp; State New
York</a>) – that’s impossible without major business expansion. He
criticized leaders who drive businesses (and wealthy taxpayers) away. So
he would likely offer a very business-friendly environment: lower taxes
(or at least not raising them), reducing red tape, and openly courting
companies from high-growth sectors (tech, biotech, fintech, etc.).
Tilson even said NYC should treat companies as valued customers rather
than enemies. He was probably dismayed by Amazon’s pullout and would
<strong>make sure NYC doesn’t “lose” such opportunities again</strong>.
For big developments like casinos, he’s not morally opposed (he’s an
investor type who might see them as economic drivers, though he’d weigh
social costs). But net-net, Tilson would <strong>prioritize keeping and
luring large businesses</strong> – including supporting big real estate
projects – because he sees them as crucial to expanding jobs and the tax
base. He’d likely reinstate something like the Bloomberg-era Fashion
Avenue or tech hub initiatives to cluster industries here.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Sliwa is in a tricky spot: as a
Republican, he generally supports businesses, but he’s also a populist
who rails against elites at times. During his 2021 run, he actually
supported the idea of Amazon coming to NYC (contrasting with AOC). He
said we should have gotten the Amazon jobs but with better negotiation.
Sliwa would certainly prefer companies here than elsewhere – he often
bemoans taxpaying New Yorkers fleeing to Florida or Jersey. So he’d
<strong>encourage big businesses to stay and come</strong>. He might not
give them huge subsidies because he also champions not wasting taxpayer
money, but he’d cut taxes broadly which itself benefits big companies.
For developments like stadiums or casinos: Sliwa supported a casino on
Coney Island, for instance, believing it would create jobs. He’s a
sports guy (worked in talk radio) and supported building/upgrading
stadiums if it means jobs and development (but he hated de Blasio’s
handling of things like pulling NYPD from events). He likely thinks the
private sector should fund these projects with maybe some city
facilitation. So yes, Sliwa would lean toward <strong>attracting large
developments</strong> – he has a very boosterish love for NYC and
wouldn’t want to see it lose out. He’d definitely try to reverse the
narrative of businesses leaving by making NYC more business-friendly
(cutting business taxes, reducing regulations he finds onerous, etc.).
In summary, Sliwa would <strong>prioritize bringing and keeping big
businesses/projects</strong> in NYC, and would loudly call out any
“foolish politicians” he thinks drive them away.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Cuomo as governor oversaw the passage
of one of the nation’s most ambitious climate laws (the CLCPA,
committing NY to net-zero by 2050) and invested in green infrastructure
like offshore wind farms and transmission lines for Canadian hydro. He
is proud of that legacy (<a class="underline hover:text-blue-600"

York Passes Strongest Climate Act in the Nation | Audubon New York</a>).
Cuomo is willing to spend big on infrastructure – he sees it as part of
his governing style (e.g. he invested in MTA upgrades, airports, etc.).
For climate, he launched a $3 billion resiliency bond act (though voters
approved it after he left). If mayor, Cuomo would likely pursue
<strong>ambitious climate projects and green jobs programs</strong> and
leverage his Albany connections for funding. He might push for things
like fast-tracking congestion pricing to reduce emissions and fund
transit. “Regardless of cost” – Cuomo is somewhat pragmatic: he wouldn’t
bankrupt the city, but he’s comfortable with heavy upfront spending for
long-term benefit (e.g. he spent billions on state renewable energy
credits). He famously said “we can’t afford not to go green” in the long
run. So expect Cuomo to <strong>heavily invest in climate resilience
(seawalls, flood protection)</strong> and clean energy (solar on city
buildings, perhaps a waste-to-energy plant to reduce landfill, etc.),
even if the price is high – as long as he can justify it with
economic/job benefits. He might frame it as a Green New Deal for NYC,
boasting it creates tens of thousands of jobs. In essence, Cuomo would
treat climate infrastructure similar to how he treats other big
infrastructure – worth doing big and fast.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Lander is very enthusiastic about
ambitious climate action and sees it as a twin opportunity to create
green jobs. As Comptroller, he pushed city pension funds to divest from
fossil fuels and invest in renewables – he views it as financially and
morally right. Lander would likely spare little expense to meet climate
goals: he’d invest in things like expanding solar installations,
electrifying city vehicles and buses, building protected greenways, and
retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency. He strongly supports Local
Law 97 enforcement (carbon emission cuts for buildings). He also has
talked about economic justice through climate action (job training in
renewables for NYCHA residents, etc.). So yes, Lander would
<strong>support heavy investment in green jobs and
infrastructure</strong>, even if it means significant spending – he’d
argue it pays off via job creation and avoiding climate disaster costs.
For example, he’d likely fund a large-scale workforce development for
wind turbine technicians if offshore wind is taking off. He might even
propose a municipal green bank to finance private building retrofits. In
summary, Lander’s priority on climate is high; he’d treat meeting NYC’s
climate targets as non-negotiable and <strong>allocate substantial
capital budget</strong> to resilience projects (like sewer upgrades,
flood protection) and renewable projects, seeing the cost as necessary
and worthwhile.</p>

green jobs and climate justice. In the Senate, she sponsored bills to
create worker cooperatives in renewable energy and pushed for the Build
Public Renewables Act (to have NY’s public power authority develop
renewable projects – which passed in 2023). She firmly believes in
massive public investment in climate solutions <em>and</em> making sure
the jobs go to local, union workers. Ramos would <strong>embrace
ambitious climate spending “regardless of cost,”</strong> framing it as
an urgent investment in the future. She’d likely set up programs for
training oil and gas workers to transition to solar/wind jobs, install
solar panels on city properties aggressively, expand community solar in
environmental justice neighborhoods, and invest in EV charging
infrastructure even if the payback is long-term. Also, representing an
area hit by storms (she’s from Queens where Ida flooding was deadly),
she would champion expensive but vital resiliency projects (probably
pushing for completing East Side Coastal Resiliency, rebuilding sewer
systems, etc.). Ramos often says you can’t put a price on saving the
planet for the next generation. She also supported congestion pricing
and would use its revenue for sustainable transit. So yes, as mayor
Ramos would <strong>heavily invest in climate initiatives</strong> –
she’d spend the political and financial capital needed to meet NYC’s
climate goals, arguing that the alternative costs (storms, heat deaths)
are far worse.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Myrie strongly supports climate
action (he voted for the CLCPA and the Build Public Renewables Act). But
he’s also cautious about costs on working-class constituents (for
example, he might be mindful of not unduly raising utility rates to pay
for green projects). Still, in principle, he has spoken about climate
change being a top threat and the need for big responses. In his
million-unit housing plan, he also integrated green building practices.
He’d likely continue the city’s planned climate investments and perhaps
expand them – e.g., accelerating the timetable for city fleet
electrification, or putting more money into rooftop solar on schools
(which he’s mentioned in past interviews). He’d see the job creation
aspect as a plus too – maybe establishing a goal for NYC to become a hub
for offshore wind assembly or urban agriculture. Myrie’s approach might
be a notch more moderate than someone like Ramos – he’d try to secure
federal/state funds and use them wisely – but he wouldn’t shy from
<strong>ambitious goals with hefty price tags</strong>, like fortifying
the subway from flooding or covering the Cross-Bronx Expressway with
green decking (an idea floating that he might back). Overall, Myrie
would <strong>invest heavily in climate resilience and green
infrastructure</strong>, just ensuring the spending is equitable and
doesn’t burden the poor (he’d favor progressive funding mechanisms like
taxes on the wealthy or leveraging federal grants, rather than
regressive fees).</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Mamdani would enthusiastically
pursue a Green New Deal for NYC no matter the cost. He and the DSA are
big proponents of publicly-owned renewable energy, expanded public
transit, and job guarantees in the green sector. Mamdani would likely
propose extremely ambitious programs – e.g., making buses free (which
doubles as climate policy to shift people from cars), or municipal solar
installations on every feasible rooftop, or a city-run green jobs corps
employing thousands to plant urban forests, install insulation in homes,
etc. The upfront costs would be huge, but Mamdani’s philosophy is to tax
the rich and corporations to pay for it. He’d support issuing municipal
bonds if needed because he views climate change as an existential threat
requiring wartime-like mobilization. Mamdani also would push to ban new
fossil fuel infrastructure in NYC and heavily invest in NYCHA retrofits,
even if billions are needed. “Regardless of cost” fits his outlook –
because he believes the cost of inaction (floods, heat waves) is far
greater. So Mamdani would <strong>prioritize achieving climate goals
with big public investments</strong> very highly, likely even willing to
trim other areas (like NYPD budget) to fund climate programs. In short,
Mamdani would treat the climate crisis with maximum urgency and
spending, akin to a NYC-level Green New Deal that he’d want to implement
immediately.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Stringer has long been a climate
hawk – as BP he released sustainability plans, as Comptroller he pushed
divestment from fossil fuels and criticized de Blasio for delays on
climate projects. He also proposed a comprehensive “climate resilience
plan” in 2021 including installing neighborhood cooling centers,
greening streets, accelerating coastal protections, etc., funded by a
mix of city funds and bonds. So he is willing to invest a lot – he
understands the fiscal side and still believes it’s prudent to spend on
climate. In fact, he’s likely to say borrowing for long-term climate
infrastructure is fiscally responsible given low interest rates and
urgent needs. He’d aim for both mitigation (cutting emissions via
renewable energy, perhaps expanding solar mandates on new buildings) and
adaptation (flood defenses). Expect Stringer to <strong>pour capital
budget dollars into resiliency projects</strong> like upgrading storm
sewers, and to push ambitious goals like all city electricity from
renewables by 2030 (he championed that as Comptroller). He might
resurrect some Bloomberg-era ideas like a green buildings task force,
but with stronger benchmarks. Regarding cost, Stringer would try to
finance climate spending smartly (through bonds, federal grants) but
ultimately he would <strong>not shy away from heavy investment</strong>
– he knows the city’s economy and survival depend on it. He might create
a dedicated climate infrastructure fund. So yes, an ambitious climate
agenda with significant spending would be a hallmark of a Stringer
mayoralty.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Blake would support ambitious
climate goals, but he might frame it through the lens of environmental
justice and job training. He would invest in programs that bring green
jobs to underserved communities – even if costly – because it tackles
multiple issues (jobs + climate). Blake tends to be collaborative; he
might work with private companies for climate solutions (like
public-private partnerships to install EV chargers in the Bronx,
employing local youth). He’d back heavy spending on resilience
especially for areas like the Bronx River flooding zones, given his
district experiences. I suspect Blake would push city pension funds to
invest in local green projects and maybe create incentives for
businesses to adopt green practices. He might not use the phrase
“regardless of cost,” but in practice he’d likely <strong>vote for big
climate budgets</strong>. His track record in Assembly includes support
for the CLCPA and for funding NYCHA boilers (to reduce emissions and
provide heat). So as mayor, he’d <strong>allocate significant resources
to climate actions</strong>, while ensuring minority communities get
contracts and jobs from these projects (that’s a big emphasis for him).
He may also focus on things like expanding CitiBike and transit to
reduce car reliance – which requires spending on infrastructure. All in
all, Blake would commit NYC to ambitious climate targets and put money
behind them, trusting that with federal help and improved efficiencies
it’s manageable.</p>

handled cases involving environmental issues (he represented the Niagara
Falls Water Board in a case; he’s tackled fracking litigation too). He’s
expressed that climate change is real and needs action. Walden might
approach it in a technocratic way: identify the highest-impact projects
and go after them efficiently, cost be damned if the ROI (in terms of
prevented damage) is worth it. He likely sees the long-term cost-benefit
of fortifying the city against climate threats. So Walden would
<strong>invest heavily in resilience infrastructure</strong> – seawalls,
storm surge barriers, upgraded drainage – because he’d reason the cost
of not doing so (flood damage) exceeds the upfront spending. He’s less
ideological about green jobs, but he’d certainly promote renewables to
modernize the grid and create jobs incidentally. Since he draws
Bloomberg comparisons, note that Bloomberg invested a lot in climate
plans like PlaNYC; Walden would be similar. He’d also emphasize
accountability in spending – e.g., he’d implement rigorous project
management on climate projects to ensure money is well-spent, but he’d
still allocate it. So yes, Walden would <strong>pursue ambitious climate
goals and marshal the funds to do so</strong>, framing it as
safeguarding NYC’s future competitiveness and livability.</p>

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Tilson is a strong supporter of
climate action (as an investor, he’s spoken about the risks of climate
change and the need for corporate responsibility). He pushed for New
York’s charter cap to be lifted, but also likely supported CLCPA given
his alignment with DFER (DFER folks are typically moderate on economics
but generally accept climate science and solutions). More concretely,
Tilson personally has invested in green companies like electric vehicle
startups, etc., so he appreciates the value of green tech. As mayor, he
would see climate resilience as crucial to protecting property values
and the city’s economy. He’d probably take a cost-benefit approach:
spend money where it clearly prevents larger future losses or creates
future savings (he might, for instance, be skeptical of some
smaller-bore spending if not convinced of its efficacy). But for big
items – like reinforcing the power grid to handle EVs and heat waves, or
building berms in Lower Manhattan – I think he’d support them as wise
investments. On renewable energy, he’d be favorable if he believes they
ultimately reduce costs (like solar eventually paying for itself).
“Regardless of cost” might make him uneasy if something seems
inefficient – he’s a value investor by nature – but he wouldn’t
penny-pinch on obviously necessary climate expenses. So Tilson would
<strong>heavily invest in climate initiatives</strong> that he deems
high-impact, and he’d work to involve the private sector too (maybe
encouraging venture capital in NYC cleantech, etc.). In summary, though
Tilson is cost-conscious, he recognizes climate change as a profound
threat and would <strong>not hesitate to spend big on major climate and
green energy projects</strong> if they secure NYC’s future (<a class="underline hover:text-blue-600"

                        <p class="text-slate-700"> Sliwa is likely the most skeptical of
heavy spending on climate of this group. He hasn’t emphasized climate
issues much on his radio show or campaign – his focus is crime, etc. He
accepts basic environmental improvements (he supported more parks, for
instance), but he might view some ambitious climate proposals as elitist
or not an immediate priority compared to public safety and
affordability. For example, he opposed congestion pricing (he argued
it’s just a tax on outer borough drivers). He might roll back some green
regulations he sees as burdensome (like if he thinks Local Law 97 fines
will hurt small co-op owners, he’d try to postpone or soften it). Sliwa
definitely cares about protecting the city from disasters, but he might
favor simpler approaches (like more emergency shelters, mobile
generators) rather than massive infrastructure like storm surge barriers
(which he might consider too expensive and years away). On renewable
investments, he’d probably say let the private sector lead; he wouldn’t
pump city money into green startups or the like. So Sliwa would
<strong>not prioritize “regardless of cost” climate spending</strong> –
he’d pick and choose affordable measures. He’d likely continue basic
resiliency projects that are already funded, but he wouldn’t champion
new big-ticket climate initiatives, especially if they raise taxes or
costs for residents. Essentially, Sliwa would allocate resources to
climate insofar as not doing so clearly endangers people (he’d invest in
flood drainage in low-lying areas that repeatedly flood, sure), but
anything beyond the obvious life-safety measures, he’d be reluctant to
spend lavishly on. He might also downplay long-term emissions goals in
favor of immediate issues like trash cleanup and rodent control (which
he oddly ties into environmental quality). So his stance is
<strong>cautious on heavy climate spending</strong>, willing to do some
but not “whatever it takes” if it means very high costs or economic
side-effects.</p>
